Map Stanford CoreNLP Annotation to [NAF format](https://github.com/newsreader/NAF)

Work in progress
Get Stanford [dcoref](https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/dcoref.shtml) in KAFDocument format

Output of the following annotators will be mapped to the KAFDocument:
tokenize, ssplit, pos, lemma, ner, parse, dcoref
